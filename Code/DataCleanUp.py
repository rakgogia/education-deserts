# Read school info data

# We will ask the question is there at least more than one school within a particular polygon (point in polygon)?
# Yes--> Not education desert
# No --> Education desert

# Single case study:

# assign them to polys, to speed up subsequent search.

### ELS data sets (in progress!)

Data1.head()
Data1.columns.values
Data2.head()
Data3.head()


# Force the first couple of columns as category.

# Rename student ID column so they match across data sets.
Data3.rename(columns={'Stu_ID': 'STU_ID'}, inplace=True)


# Combine the data 2, and pat of data 3 sets by 'STU_ID'
Combined1=pd.merge(Data2,Data3.loc[:,['STU_ID','F3ISTATE','F3IIPED']],on='STU_ID')
# Data dimensions overall
Combined1.shape

# 58341 rows and 51 columns
Combined1.head()

# Missing data?

# Separating out the features
x = df.loc[:, features].values

### Notes: F3PSLLVL stores the F3ILEVEL value from the sample member's 
# record on the ELS third follow-up student- institution file where 
# F3ILASTINST=1. See F3ILASTINST for further information regarding 
# identification of the respondent's last/currently attended 
# postsecondary institution.
